# bayesplot 1.0.0.9000

* The `stat` argument for all `ppc_stat_*` functions now accepts a function 
instead of only the name of a function.
* `xaxis_title(FALSE)` and `yaxis_title(FALSE)` now set axis titles to `NULL` rather than changing theme elements to element_blank. This makes it easier to add axis titles to plots that donâ€™t have them by default.

# bayesplot 1.0.0

* Initial CRAN release
