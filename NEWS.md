# bayesplot 1.0.0.9000

* The `stat` argument for all `ppc_stat_*` functions now accepts a function
instead of only the name of a function. (#31)
* `xaxis_title(FALSE)` and `yaxis_title(FALSE)` now set axis titles to `NULL` 
rather than changing theme elements to element_blank. This makes it easier to 
add axis titles to plots that donâ€™t have them by default. (#53)
* Images in vignettes should now render
properly. Thanks to TJ Mahr. (#51)

# bayesplot 1.0.0

* Initial CRAN release
